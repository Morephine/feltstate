## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - initial

First public release: a clean, dependency-free reference implementation of a
felt inner-state engine for LLM agents.

### Added

- **Affect state** (`feltstate.state`): `AffectState` and its parts — `Mood`,
  `Traits`, `Relationship`, `PressureState`, plus the per-turn `AffectDelta`.
- **Dynamics** (`feltstate.affect`): a multi-bar pressure/release cycle
  (`pressure`), asymmetric hedonic-adaptation trait EWMA (`traits`), and
  symmetric permanent imprints (`imprint`).
- **Memory** (`feltstate.memory`): `Canon`, a decaying 5W1H fact store.
- **Time awareness** (`feltstate.timeawareness`): fuzzy "how long since we
  spoke" + precise "now".
- **Render** (`feltstate.render`): `render_felt_block` (first-person, cache-stable)
  and `build_injection` (cache-safe placement).
- **Sources** (`feltstate.sources`): the `AffectSource` interface, a
  zero-dependency `KeywordSource`, and an OpenAI-compatible `LLMSource`.
- **Engine** (`feltstate.engine`): the `Engine` façade — `tick` / `render` / `inject`.
- README and PHILOSOPHY; two runnable examples; tests across every module;
  ruff + mypy + CI configuration.
